        Welcome to my website about powerliftng, a weightlifting sport in which people compete in three main lifts. Competitors are grouped into classes by weight and gender. There are several different organizations — called federations — in the U.S. through which people can compete. Here are a few of the largest ones:
            <ul>
              <li>USAPL</li>
              <li>IPA</li>
              <li>UPA</li>
            </ul>
